###Assignment 1: Familiarize with GitHub
See https://github.com/jvani/gittest_jvani

1. Created a repo and file.
2. Fixed merge conflict.
3. Forked repos from Ben Miller, Ian Wright, and Ian Stuart.
4. Merged both of their pull requests into my file.

###Assignment 2: Set up environmental variable and alias
1. To set up the environmental variable, I logged into compute and added the PUI2016 variable and pui2016 alias my .bash_profile in nano. 
2. After saving and exiting nano I reloaded my .bash_profile by using:
  ```
	. .bash_profile 
	```

Below is a preview of my edited .bash_profile:

###Assigment 3
See PUI2016_jmv423/HW1_jmv423/HW1_3_jmv423.ipynb

1. Generated one reproducible 2x100 array of random numbers.
2. Produced 50 2x100 arrays with the mean increasing 0.25xi for each array 0:50.
3. Modified the 50 arrays so the mean of the x axis increased by 0.25(i) and the mean of the y axis increased by 0.5(i).
4. Plotted both sets of 50x2x100 arrays.

a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly

THe null and alternative hypothesis are:

Ho: 24 passes are purchased in equal or less amounts on weekends as on weekdays.
Ha: More 24hr passes are purchased on weekends (Sat - Sun) than weekdays.

jmv423, you need to add a significance level at the beginning of the experiment for it to valid (alpha = .05). 
Aside fromt the lack of that the Ho and Ha looked to be formulated properly

b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question,
and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet).

Indeed the necessary data does exist in the data table and the initial exploratory tests seem to bear out the relevancy of the 
hypothesis. 



c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. 


I would use a chi square to test the H0 variable. Under the null hypothesis a more or less uniform amount of 24hr passes
will be purchased on any given day of the week. We want to use the chi square to see if the actual observed values of 24hr 
passes differs from the expected number of 25hr passes if day of the week was not significant.

"""Use the chi-square goodness of fit test to determine whether observed sample frequencies differ significantly from expected
frequencies specified in the null hypothesis. """

###Task 1: Set up environmental variable and alias
1. To set up the environmental variable, I logged into compute and added the PUI2106 variable and pui2016 alias my .bash_profile in nano. 
2. After saving and exiting nano I reloaded my .bash_profile by using:
  ```
	. .bash_profile 
	```

Below is a preview of my edited .bash_profile:
